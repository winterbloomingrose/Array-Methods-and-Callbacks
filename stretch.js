/* Task 3: Stretch Goals

After you have completed the requirements, create a new file called `stretch.js` and practice with Array methods more.

See if you can complete one or more of the following challenges:

- [ ] Create a function that takes country initials as a parameter and returns their total number of World Cup appearances.
- [ ] Account for ties in your 'finals' data set
- [ ] Create a function that takes country initials as a parameter and determines how many goals that country has scored in World Cup games since 1930.
- [ ] Use `.map()` to format country names into `<h1>` HTML headers.
